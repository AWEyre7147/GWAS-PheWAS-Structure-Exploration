# GWAS-PheWAS-Structure-Exploration

This project will implement two codes that will input either genotype or phenotype data and run a number of classification analyses.  These analyses include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), Autoencoders (AE), and Variational Autoencoders (VAE).  Each of these offer a unique perspective on the data, some being better to determine the relatedness between samples and others the differences.  The main goal with the genotype data is to identify population structure in the data that may violate the assumptions of GWAS unless downstream corrections are utilized.  The goal with the phenotype data is to also identify structure with the intention of identifying groupings in the data.  Since phenotype data is widely variable, including both quantitative traits with the potential of different scales and various qualitative data, it will be up to the user to do the preprocessing work needed to utilize this tool.  Notes and more will be made available as the project expands.
